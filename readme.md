# Gradle Custom Plugin Navigation
A simple plugin for IntelliJ, not published in the marketplace

## What can do
- navigate to definition files of plugins you made(from _build.gradle_ file)

not supported yet: 
- navigation between **Kotlin**(_.build.kts_) files
- navigation from an argument of the legacy `apply` method 

## Why not be published?
I found the same features are already existed in some plugins AFTER I implemented this.  
MARKET RESEARCH IS IMPORTANT, seriously.

## In future
(Maybe) merge these features to existing plugins since it seems that the features are not fully covered.

##### If you want to try
1. Clone this repo
2. Execute `gradle build`
3. Open IntelliJ idea 
4. Call _Install Plugin from Disk_ action and specify the jar file(generated by gradle build)
